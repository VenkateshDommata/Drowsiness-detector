## **Project: Drowsiness Detection Model using Deep Learning**

I worked on building a **drowsiness detection model** using deep learning. The key steps I completed are:

### **1. Dataset Processing:**
- Loaded images of **open and closed eyes** from the dataset.
- Created a structured **DataFrame** to store **image paths and labels**.

### **2. Data Augmentation & Preprocessing:**
- Used `ImageDataGenerator` to apply augmentations (**rotation, brightness, flipping**) to improve generalization.
- Split the dataset into **training, validation, and test sets**.

### **3. Model Development:**
- Used **MobileNet** as the base model (**without top layers**) for feature extraction.
- Added **custom layers** and trained a **binary classification model** using:
  - **Adam optimizer**
  - **Binary cross-entropy loss**
  - **Early stopping & model checkpointing** to prevent overfitting.

### **4. Training & Evaluation:**
- Achieved **98.7% accuracy** on the **training set** and **98.6% validation accuracy**.
- Evaluated the model on the **test set**, achieving **84.8% test accuracy**.
- Generated a **confusion matrix** and **classification report** to analyze model performance.

### **5. Predictions:**
- Tested the model on a **new image**, and successfully classified it as **open eyes** with high confidence.

## **6. Eye Detection with Haar Cascade (OpenCV)**
This week, I integrated **eye detection** using **Haar cascades in OpenCV**.  

ðŸ“Œ **How it works:**
- Used the **haarcascade_eye.xml** classifier to detect eyes from the webcam in real-time.
- Captured frames, applied the classifier, and **highlighted detected eyes with green rectangles**.
- The system continues detection **until the 'q' key is pressed** to stop the webcam feed.

### **Code Breakdown:**
âœ” **Initialization:**  
- The code accesses the **webcam** using `cv2.VideoCapture()`.  
- Haar cascade classifiers are loaded using `cv2.CascadeClassifier()`.  

âœ” **Detection:**  
- Each **captured frame** is converted to **grayscale** for better accuracy.  
- The `detectMultiScale()` method detects **eyes**.

âœ” **Output:**  
- The detected **eyes are highlighted** with rectangles.  
- The **resulting frame** is shown in a window.

## **7. Model Integration with OpenCV for Real-Time Eye State Detection**
ðŸ“Œ Integration Approach

Successfully bridged the machine learning model with OpenCV's real-time video capture. Implemented a seamless workflow for eye detection and state classification.

âœ” Technical Integration Process

Model Preparation:

Utilized a pre-trained neural network for binary eye state classification.

Configured the model to work with live video stream inputs.

Ensured compatibility between model input requirements and OpenCV frame capture.

Real-Time Processing Workflow:

Capture video frames using OpenCV's VideoCapture.

Detect eye regions using Haar Cascade Classifier.

Extract and preprocess detected eye regions for model prediction.

Perform real-time classification of eye state.

âœ” Preprocessing Steps:

Convert detected eye region to grayscale.

Resize eye image to model's expected input dimension (224x224 pixels).

Normalize pixel values (scale to 0-1 range).

Add batch dimension for model input using np.expand_dims().

âœ” Prediction Mechanism:
final_image = cv2.resize(eyes_roi, (224, 224))
final_image = np.expand_dims(final_image, axis=0)  # Add batch dimension
final_image = final_image / 255.0  # Normalize image

âœ” Visualization and Feedback:

Display eye state in real-time on the video frame.

Use color-coded text for different eye states:

ðŸŸ¢ Green for "Open Eyes"

ðŸ”´ Red for "Closed Eyes"

## **8. Enhanced Drowsiness Detection and Alert System (This Week's Progress)**

ðŸ“Œ **System Improvements:**
- Added **facial detection** to improve the system's robustness.
- Implemented a **drowsiness counter** that tracks consecutive frames with closed eyes.
- Created an **alert system** that triggers when drowsiness is detected:
  - **Visual alerts:** Red bounding boxes and "Sleep Alert!!" warning text.
  - **Audio alerts:** Multi-tone beep sequence to effectively wake the driver.
- Enhanced the **UI with color-coded status indicators**.
- Implemented a **counter reset mechanism** when eyes reopen.
- Optimized the **detection parameters** for better real-time performance.

âœ” **Current Status:**

The system now successfully:
- Detects both **face and eyes** in real-time video feed.
- Classifies **eye state (open/closed)** using the pre-trained model.
- Monitors for **prolonged eye closure** (more than 10 frames).
- Triggers both **visual and audio alerts** when drowsiness is detected.
- Provides **continuous feedback** through the UI.

## **Next Steps:**

âœ… **Frame Recognition Optimization:**  
- Fine-tuning the **frame rate** for better performance without excessive delays.  

âœ… **Final Improvements:**
- **Fine-tune** the drowsiness threshold based on testing.
- Implement **additional alert types** (possibly vibration or text notifications).
- Create a **logging system** to record drowsiness events.
